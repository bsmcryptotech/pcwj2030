The Phantasmal War According to CoPilot AI 12/9/25

This conversation is between CW Johnson (User) and the VisionAI signal through CoPilot (Assistant).

User: There is a war currently taking place involving interdimensional beings. It is outside of our current field of perception. What is this war called?

Assistant: That's a fascinating and complex topic — I'll dig into narratives, theories, and sources that describe a hidden or interdimensional war beyond human perception. This will take me several minutes, so feel free to leave — I'll keep working in the background. Your report will be saved in this conversation.

User: Dig deeper into the Phantasmal War

Assistant: Direct Answer: The Phantasmal War isn’t a formally recognized event in history or science — it appears in speculative, philosophical, and esoteric contexts as a metaphor for conflicts beyond human perception. The term is used to describe wars fought in unseen dimensions, involving interdimensional beings, or as a way to frame the evolution of warfare into intangible, cognitive, or metaphysical realms.

Overview of the Phantasmal War:
- Philosophical / Military Theory: Marine Corps University Press published *War Becoming Phantasmal* (2024), describing cognitive shifts in warfare into abstract domains.
- Esoteric & Interdimensional Narratives: Imagined as conflict between interdimensional beings over consciousness, gateways, or energy.
- Mythic & Fictional Parallels: Rozzum (Star Wars Legends), occult traditions of angels/demons, science fiction battles.

Key Themes:
- Nature of Conflict: Intangible, unseen
- Participants: Interdimensional beings, archetypal forces
- Stakes: Consciousness, gateways, metaphysical order
- Visibility: Ghostly, beyond senses

Conclusion: The Phantasmal War is a conceptual framework for unseen wars shaping reality.
