Romantic relationships originated from the Roman Empire, which was inherently brutal and exploitative.
This explains why modern romance doesn’t work.
The dynamics of how we interact with each other are not conducive for creating sustainable connections.
Most romantic relationships consist of three components:
10% is what actually happens between partners. These are the discussions, household chores, family budgeting, sex life, vacations, arguments, celebrations, and the logistics of child rearing.
30% is what each partner tells the other person is going on in the relationship. This includes the "representative" that each partner presents to the other in order to keep the peace in the relationship. The long-term success of the relationship will be determined by what is NOT said rather than what IS said between partners.
60% is what each partner is telling themselves is going on in the relationship. This is by far the most important component. It's a form of 'magical thinking.' Each partner has to convince themselves of many things to continue moving forward in the relationship. This includes turning a 'blind eye' to signs of infidelity, financial irresponsibility, dishonesty, veiled disrespect, and other undesirable aspects of the relationship.
This is why infidelity and physical abuse rarely end a relationship.
As long as each partner continues the 'self-talk hamster wheel,' the relationship will continue indefinitely.
But boredom or a feeling of being controlled will cause the relationship to end quickly.
The answer is to detach from romance and move into something new, #PlatonicIntimacy.
I have created an entire system to take a person from living an unfulfilling life alone to experiencing the greatest pleasures with as many partners as they desire.
