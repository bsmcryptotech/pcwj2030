Sacred Eros Text
Who am I?
I am Pastor CW Johnson.
You can learn more about my work on my website www.platonicintimacy.com.
With the assistance and sacrifice of the women in my amazing soul tribe, I created an entire system for masculine and feminine energy transmutation called Kama Shakti Metaphysical Tantra.
In this context, Kama Shakti means "The Desire For Power."
My work is centered on empowering individuals through my proven methods.
For the past 18 years, I have been performing sensual bodywork to help my clients reach the highest levels of relaxation.
For the past 4 years, I have studied authentic Vedic Tantra under the guidance of Guru Shajesh via his online school.
My current practice is a fusion of the ancient arts and modern experiential metaphysics.
This makes a session with me blissful, unique, and kinetic!
I intentionally assess each new client's situation during the intake process which makes each experience customized to your specific physical and energetic needs.
Where am I?
I currently spend the majority of my time in Phoenix AZ.
Whenever I'm in town, can come to a client's home, office, or hotel room.
I host extended sessions at local Air BnB locations all over the Phoenix Metro area.
I'm also available to travel nationwide to meet you in your city.
Travel and lodging accommodations are extra.
What do I offer?
Tantra Touch sessions are for in-person clients of all genders and come in two intensity levels.
Light Tantra is for beginners who simply want experience the physical benefits of my work.
Deep Tantra is for clients who are ready for full Kundalini experiences. These sessions are clothing-optional.
Tantra Immersion is for in-person or virtual clients of all genders who wish to experience my aura on a purely energetic level.
I use UV light pulses and low frequency sound waves to connect to my clients on the subconscious and superconscious levels.
Tantra Coaching is for clients of all genders and couples who wish to learn my methods and integrate them into their personal lives.
I offer Metaphysical Life Coaching sessions to clients of any gender.
This is a "warm-up" to get clients mentally, physially, and emotionally prepared to engage in tantric experiences.
For men, I offer two basic coaching options.
Sacred Masculine Framing is a comprehensive dive into the inner masculine domain from the perspective of the anima.
Alchemical Dominance is a crash course on how to attract women who will submit to your will and stay cooperative for as long as you desire.
For women, I offer Sacred Container Training.
This is detailed guidance on exactly how to create your own paradigm container that will attract the types of people and interactions you wish to manifest.
For couples, I offer the Alchemy of Platonic Intimacy.
My current relationships with five women are the perfect examples of how Platonic Intimacy can lead to fulfilling lifestyles for everyone involved.
Immersive Retreats are extended sessions that include my entire range of tantric modalities.
Up to four clients can enjoy this amazing experience.
To maximize our comfort and ability to connect, I book an Air BnB for these sessions.
This is only offered to women.
I offer many other options for healing and bonding sessions including long-term direct connections for those of you who want to explore our options beyond the scope of my tantric healing work.
I also sell visualization videos that provide the opportunity to gain alignment vicariously through my recorded rituals.
